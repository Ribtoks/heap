A very basic implementation of polynoms in Ruby. Provides class for basic operations with polynomials like parsing, sum, product.
Supports parsing a string of this format: -3*x^4*y+z*x*y * y*4-5 + x^4. Supports sum and multiplication of polynoms (skips whitespaces). Provides simple interface to polynom structure. Is fully covered with tests.
