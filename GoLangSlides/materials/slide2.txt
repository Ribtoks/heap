Principes of Go
---------------

Go is:
Simple
- concepts are easy to understand
- (the implementation might still be sophisticated)
Orthogonal
- concepts mix cleanly
- easy to understand and predict what happens
Succinct
- no need to predeclare every intention
Safe
- misbehavior should be detected
