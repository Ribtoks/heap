Differences with C++
(implicit things gone)

- pointers but no pointer arithmetic
- p++ is a statement, not expression (no concusion about order of evaluation)
- no implicit numerical conversions
- constants are just numbers (no size of sign, high precision, truncated or
rounded when assigned)
- methods are declared like ordinary functions with receiver, methods are not
mixed with data definition
- interfaces are abstract, everything other is concrete, interfaces are
satisfied implicitly (compile time duck typing)
